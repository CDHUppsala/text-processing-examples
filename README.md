## Lemmatisation with efselab
We here showcase how (pefselab)[https://github.com/skogsgren/pefselab] is used for lemmatising our example data.

Follow (pefselab's')[https://github.com/skogsgren/pefselab] instructions. Also, make sure you have a new enough version of Python.

To run the code here, you also need nltk. (With e.g., conda: `conda install anaconda::nltk`).

You first need to run `create_pefselab_pipeline.py` once, to create the NLP pipeline. Then you can run the script for lemmatisation. `run_lemmatise_motions.sh`.
