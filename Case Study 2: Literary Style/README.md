## Case Study 2: Literary Style

In this folder materials can be found for the second case study on literary style. The folder includes the script `literary_style.ipynb`, the metadata file (`literary_style.csv`) and the corpus with the processed novels in CONLL format (in folder named `corpus`) which are needed to execute the code (added soon).

## How to use the script

The script is written in a jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and can be opened in jupyter notebook or jupyter lab. Download the code, the corpus with the novels and the metadata file, store the files in a suitable place on your computer, provide the paths to the right folders in the notebook where ´yourpath´ is written. Now you can start executing the code blocks.
